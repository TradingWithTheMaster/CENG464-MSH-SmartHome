# CENG464-MSH-SmartHome
1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
The My Sweet Home (MSH) project is a foundational C++ endeavor focused on developing a comprehensive smart home management system. Our primary objective was designing a robust, extensible core to simulate a central control panel that manages various IoT devices, including smart TVs, cameras, lighting units, and critical safety detectors. The project’s core goal is to showcase the practical application of industry-standard Design Patterns—specifically the Factory, State, and Facade patterns—to solve complex architectural and maintenance challenges.



1.2 Purpose and Scope
The MSH system provides users with a flexible, text-based Menu interface for essential device management, enabling them to quickly add, remove, and adjust device power states. It facilitates seamless switching between predefined Home Modes (Normal, Evening, Party, Cinema) to instantly adjust the environment based on user preference. Furthermore, the system incorporates critical automated safety and security sequences for intrusion detection and fire response. Our final software architecture is intentionally layered, ensuring the clear separation of device logic from system control for maximum extensibility and maintainability.



1.3 Technologies & Tools
This project adheres to modern development standards and utilizes the following key tools:


Language: C++ (ISO Standard).


Design: UML Class Diagrams for structural modeling.


Version Control: Git, emphasizing branching and integration for collaborative development.


Build System: CMake / Replit.
