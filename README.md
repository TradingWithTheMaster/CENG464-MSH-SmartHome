# CENG464-MSH-SmartHome



1\. Introduction

1.1 Project Overview "My Sweet Home" (MSH) project aims to design and develop a comprehensive smart home management system using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system is designed to be a central control panel that manages various IoT devices, including lights, cameras, smart TVs, and safety detectors (smoke and gas). The core objective of this project is to demonstrate the practical implementation of industry-standard Design Patterns (such as Factory, State, and Facade) to solve complex architectural challenges.

1.2 Purpose and Scope The MSH system provides a text-based user interface (Menu) which gives the users the ability to add/remove devices, control power states, and switch between various home "Modes" (Normal, Evening, Party, Cinema) that provides specified settings depending on the user’s preference. Additionally, the system includes critical safety and security features, such as automated alarm sequences for motion detection and fire hazards. The software is designed to be extensible, maintainable, and robust, utilizing a layered architecture that separates device logic from system control logic.
